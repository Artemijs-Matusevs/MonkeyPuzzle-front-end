# Quick Start #

The easiest way to get started is to click the hamburger icon in the top right corner of the screen and to then click the "load demo" button. This will load a pre-analysed argument into the MonkeyPuzzle visualisation. You can then interact with this demo experimentally to explore the features of MonkeyPuzzle.

- The visualisation pan can be interacted with via the mouse. Right clicking will bring up a context menu that differs depending upon where you click.
- The 'h' keyboard shortcut will display the help modal
- The 'm' keyboard shortcut will toggle display of the menu pane
- The 'r' kayboard shortcut will toggle display of the resource pane
- You can zoom in and out of he visualisation using a two-finger vertical swipe. Swipe up to zoom in and down to zoom out
- Multiple nodes can be selected, i.e. for grouping, by hold shift then clicking and dragging a selection box across the nodes of interest
- Analyses can be imported and exported as SADFace (JSON) format using the SADFace button of the import and export sub-section of the menu pane.
- Images in JPG and PNG (with transparent background) format can be exported using the buttons in the export sub-section of the menu pane.


From here there are generally 3 ways of interacting with MonkeyPuzzle:

[1] Load an existing SADFace analysis via the menu pane import option and then explore or enhance that analysis
[2] Build an argument from scratch by right clicking on the visualisation and selecting "add node" to create as many nodes as are required then drawing links between the nodes by clicking and dragging the grab-handles.
[3] Create an analysis from an existing text resource. Load the text resource into a resource-pane tab (on the left of the screen, activated using the 'r' key) then select text in the resource tab to delineate atom content and then drag the selection to the visualisation pane or use puzzle piece button to create an atom. Multiple atoms can then be linked together to constuct the visualisation.

In practise, some combination of all three approaches is often used, loading an existing analysis for further work, adding new nodes from scratch when atoms aren't available in the loaded resources (or to deal with enthymemes) and loading up zero or more resource pane tabs to provide source materials for the analytical or construction process.
